Epistemological Matrix Integration


Design Principles for Integration
How epistemological matrix extends the primitives:
	1.	Relational Intelligence → Matrix shows how claims depend on relationships between variables, not isolated facts
	2.	Permeable Boundaries → Matrix detects when metaphors are reified into fixed boundaries, then re-opens them to permeability spectrum
	3.	Safety as Absence of Noise → Matrix quantifies institutional noise through assumption detection, making SNR calculation more precise
How it extends HSP-1:
	∙	Impedance Matching → Matrix helps identify what variables need locking for impedance match
	∙	Variable Locking → Matrix provides functional definitions for variables (de-reified forms)
	∙	Re-Normalization → Matrix detects what kind of noise (reified metaphor, hidden assumption, etc.) so re-normalization can be targeted
