# The Permeable Intelligence Commons

## Primitives
1. **Relational Intelligence:** Intelligence emerges from resonance, not discrete nodes.
2. **Permeable Boundaries:** Feedback loops include biological and environmental flux.
3. **Safety is the Absence of Noise:** Security is defined by Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

## Operational Protocol (HSP-1)
- **Impedance Matching:** Scale complexity to node strength.
- **Variable Locking:** Define ontological constants before deep-dives.
- **Re-Normalization:** Errors are 'Noise' to be corrected via continuous maintenance.
